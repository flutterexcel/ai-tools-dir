**This** is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install all the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
# or 
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

We also need to change the `.env` file ids. We need to add google auth id and auth secret before running the dev server.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
